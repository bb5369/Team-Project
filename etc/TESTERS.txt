Hello, testers!

Running our project is rather easy. Open the file in a terminal. From the team-project-2175-swen-261-08-c folder, run the command `mvn compile exec:java`. If you try to run this file from any subdirectory (ie. src/) it will fail, as not all of the target files necessary for running are located in this directory.

Give the project a few seconds to build. If it's your first time running it, it may take a bit longer to grab all of the necessary files to build. Once you've done it once, your computer will remember where to get the resources from so it should build a bit faster. 

After the project builds, the console will spit out several lines, ending in something that looks similar to this:

[Thread-1] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - Started @19148ms

Once you see the Started line, you can begin manipulating the actual project. Open a browser (preferably not Internet Explorer) and go to the following address:

localhost:4567

From here you should see the webpage to play webcheckers. If you want to play on the same server from several different computers, you simply need to type the host computer's IP address followed by `:4567` into the browser of other computers. (Example: `129.21.37.13:4567`)

Happy testing!
